# 50 Startups 

## Multiple Linear Regression 

A venture capital fund wants to obtain a criterion to invest in fifty startups. Based on a dataset containing: their expenditure on R & D, administration and marketing, location (state), and profit, we will find which features are significant to these startups' profits.

This was an Udemy Guided Project.

### Optional R code

You will also find an R file with the equivalent code, which is optional. This R code contains three different ways to implement Backwards Elimination. The first one consists of running the different linear models so the user can compare them. The other two ones are:

- **1.** The use of the R function **step()**.

- **2.** It is a function where an algorithm for Backward Elimination has been implemented. A significance level - SL- of 5% has been pre-set (you can copy it for your projects and experiment with other SL).

I have also added the R code with a Google Colab R runtime. So, if you are interested in knowing how to do it, please visit this site by Fidocia Wima Adityawarman, who explains how to easily change the runtime for using R in Colab:

### Descriptive statistics, histograms, and boxplots

This was not part of the main task for this project, but I have added a file in Python so you can see the descriptive statistics, histograms, and boxplots.
